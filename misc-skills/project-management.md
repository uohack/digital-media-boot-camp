# Introduction

One of the toughest things for young developers to learn is how to manage a project. It requires teamwork, time management, expectation management and most of all: have a firm timeline that results in a realistic goal.

### Teamwork

Contrary to the stereotype, most programming projects require a lot of teamwork. At a minimum you'll usually have to work with the following people:

* A designer (someone who may or may not know anything about code)
* A content person (someone developing some sort of content or product to interact with your code)
  * Sometimes this is a journalist, sometimes a marketing person, the list goes on and on.
* Your boss (someone who may or may not know anything about code)
* Yourself (yes, sometimes you need to work with yourself and provide time to focus and time for breaks)

Some projects will involve a dozen people on a committee (beware of [camels](http://www.hulu.com/watch/107054#i0,p12,d0) [a horse designed by a committee]) and some projects will only involve you and your boss. Either way, you'll have to learn how to work well with others.

The best way to do that is to **communicate** often. Make sure you have everyone's phone numbers and emails. Set up a group text or email thread and make sure that you let people know if the plan goes sideways.

The worst possible thing to do is encounter a problem and not inform your teammates. That digs you deeper into the hole and does not allow them to help you.

# Time management

Journalists love to say that they are deadline-driven workers, which is just a nice way to say that they procrastinate. We all do and that's fine as long as you have a good handle on what needs to be accomplished. If you have a major project with four parts and two weeks to finish, it should take you about two days for each part. If the first part takes a whole week, you should re-evaluate your work style.

Some deadlines, are more flexible than others. You'll want to focus on the firm deadlines before tackling the more nebulous projects.

# Expectation management

Typically a project will arise after someone has an idea and schedules a meeting to flush out that idea with the designer, content person and you (the developer). More times than not, that idea will be unattainable, unrealistic or flat out unbelievable. It is **very** important to manage expectations from the get go.

If someone throws out an idea that you know is impossible, don't be afraid to say so. Of course, you don't want to be negative, but taking the idea and changing it into something that you know is manageable is a good strategy.

As the developer you know your current and future work projects, know the system and understand the typical work flow of projects. It is your responsibility to speak up if you have doubts about something, because it is you who will have to build it.

And if you agree to something that is impossible, you will waste everyone's time. So don't be afraid to say no.

# Have a firm timeline that results in a realistic goal

I know this seems pretty self-explanatory, but there are a few key points I want to hit on.

When you first discuss a project there are two possible ways that your deadline will be set. One way is that you have a firm deadline based on a pre-existing event. In this situation, like above, you need to feel comfortable saying if that deadline is unrealistic. Again, I'm not saying just say no, but offer a more realistic solution and try to find a compromise.

The second thing, which is far more preferable, is someone will turn to you and ask how long it will take. This is a very tricky question to answer, especially if your put on the spot. You need to be honest, brutally honest. Both with yourself and the team.

You can be the best coder in the world but bugs will still pop up. And there will be last-minute design tweaks, I promise you that.

If you feel comfortable with all of the elements of the project, I would budget double the amount of time you think it will take. Because, here is what will happen:

1. You start working and some fire comes up and you have to go fix that.
1. You start working again and make good progress but a pesky bug pops up and you spend half a day tracking it down.
1. Now you have the majority done but you now have to track down the remaining bugs.
1. You feel like you're done so you start testing (hopefully you've been testing all along) and you find new bugs.
1. OK, now you're really done and you show it to someone (hopefully you've been showing it to your teammates throughout the process) and your boss wants to change the copy and find a new photo.
1. You apply the updates and show it to everyone again and there's another design tweak that's needed. You need to re-configure a grid to get that to work.
1. Ok, now you're finally, actually done and you launch.
1. A day later a user finds another bug and you get to fix that.

See what I mean? You need to budget in time to fix the unforeseen bugs.

Plus, if you're doing something for the first time, there are a lot of unknowns and you'll need to budget in time for those.

The second part of this is having a realistic goal. This goes hand in hand with [expectation management](#expectation-management) but it needs to be reiterated because having a timeline is meaningless if you have no realistic goal to end the timeline.

In other words, if you don't have a strict definition of what the goal is, you will never finish the project.

This goal needs to be realistic. It should be something you feel confident that you can accomplish in the timeframe given.

# Project management workflow

* Idea proposed
* Get full team in a room with white boards, define what the goals are and talk about the timeline
* Regroup and confirm goals and timeline after some preliminary research has been done
* All team members begin working on their respective parts of the project
* Weekly (or daily) in-person, stand-up meetings to check in on progress (these should be 5-10 minutes)
* Conclude development and start testing (basic functionality and UX with co-workers not working on the project)
* Launch project
* Measure analytics
* Debrief project
  * What worked, what didn't?
  * What did you learn? What could you repeat for other projects?
  * Does the project need to be updated?
  * How was the project received by users? (Analytics)
  * Did the finished project meet its goals?

# Wrap up

Please note, these are just my personal beliefs on project management. There are a lot of different ways to go about doing things but I think I covered all of the essentials here. 

Of course, there are a lot of smart people who have written about this. I encourage you to read as much as you can on this topic because different people prefer to work in different ways and there is no "correct" way to do this:
