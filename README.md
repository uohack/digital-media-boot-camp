# Introduction

The goal of the Digital Media Boot Camp is to teach University of Oregon students about basic digital media topics that they may not be exposed to in their regular classes.

More specifically, students can:

* learn skills that are in high demand and impress potential employers
* begin to build a technical vocabulary
* have fun while building tools to make their lives easier

While these documents will be available online, we also offer office hours for students to learn and work with mentors. We are more than happy to talk about how to build a portfolio website, analyze data in Python or anything in between.
